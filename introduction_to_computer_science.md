# COMPUTER SCIENCE

What is computer science? Computer science is the study of information.

{input} -> {algorithms and data processing} -> {output}

In computer science we use binary which is a base 2
Binary consist of bits: 0 and 1 {on and off}
A bit is a 0 or 1
Computers have millions of transistors which can be flipped either on or off. on->1 , off->0

Binary Powers: 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128

1 byte = 8 bits
KB -> MB -> GB -> TB

1111 1111 ->1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128 = 255

ASCII -> maps out language to bits
A -> 65 Z -> 90
a -> 97 z -> 122
0 -> 48 9 -> 57

01001000=>72 01001001=>73 00100001=>33
72 = H 73 = I 33= !
HI!

UNICODE-> unicode is a mapping of numbers to letters but in many different languages

RGB -> RED | GREEN | BLUE
A video is basically moving pictures
24FPS -> 24 images per second -> movies

Representing Music Notes in computer -> frequency=>Halts values -> MP4, MP3
