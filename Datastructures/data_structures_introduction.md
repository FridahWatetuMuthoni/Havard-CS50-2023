# Data Structures in C

A Data structure is a way to store and organise data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently

We talk about data structures in two ways, one as mathematical or logical models termed as Abstract data types(ADT) , two as concrete implementations

1. Abstract data types(ADT) / Mathematical or logical models
   Abstract data types are entities that are definations of data and operations
   but dont have any implementation details

Example of Abstract Data types

1. List / Arrays
2. LinkedList
3. Stack
4. Queue
5. Trees
6. Graph

How to study this data structures

1. Their logical View
2. The operations available to us
3. The cost of this operations-> time and space complexity
4. implementation
